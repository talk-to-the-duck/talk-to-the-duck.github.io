&lt;p>I will start placing a common ground about what a generic API is, and why an API is important. Because an API is a complex artifact, it’s important to show its most important features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, I will focus on HTTP APIs and how to be represented them, and then I will explain why instead of creating your own way of documenting an API, you want to use a standard way of representing HTTP APIs which is called Open API.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
