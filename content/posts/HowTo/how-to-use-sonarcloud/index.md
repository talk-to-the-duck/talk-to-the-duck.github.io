## Sonar's concept
it defines concepts like :
* projects
* quality profil
* quality gate

### project

The quality profile is the association of rules with a severity for a given language.


### Rules

### quality profil

The quality profile, is a for a language, some rules, each associated to a severity. 
To access to different existing profiles, go to your authorization and in 'Quality Profile' tab.

To create a new profil, the simplier way, is copying an existing profil.


### quality gate
A quality gate is a definition of the minimal quality attended by the new code and/or by the existing code.
The quality gate is said to fail when one of parameters is not respected.

All quality gates are listed in 'Quality Gates" tab. 
A new Quality Gate can be created copying and updating an existing quality gate, or create from crash via the 'Create' button

In your CICD if your job, running sonarqube, can't fail then the pipeline will failed if the quality gate is not respected.
