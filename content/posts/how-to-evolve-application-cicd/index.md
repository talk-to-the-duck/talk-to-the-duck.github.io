## Foreword

In the last article we detailed the tests added to our project. 
These tests are useful to check our development locally as we use TDD. But they are also useful to check if there are regressions.
In this post we will : 

* define what is the CICD
* How to add the CICD settings in our project

## What is the CICD

The CICD defines Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery. 
The CICDCD  is Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery Continuous Deployment

When we talk on CICD ( or CICDCD) we often also referred to as the CICD pipelines.
CICD pipeline defines a process where certain steps are executed one after the other, all with the aim of verifying the application before delivering it and deploying it.


## What CICD tools

There are some tools to execute CICD; we can quote:
* Gitlab-ci
* CircleCI
* GitHub Action
* Jenkins

For open sources projects as our, it's easier to use a CICD tools integrated to a web hosting and software development management service as GitLab or GitHub.
It's why we'll prefer use GitLab, CircleCi or GitHub Action.
tools as Jenkins need to deploy another service. 

In this post we will detail these solutions but only two will be implemented: 

* CircleCI
* GitHub Action


## Implementation of our CICD


### Our desired pipeline

Through our first pipeline we want to validate :

* compile the code
* validation of the code formatting
* the non-regression of the code through the execution of test


Also we want the pipeline to be run on every commit on develop branch and ci branch (with prefix ci_).
We could add other kind of branches : feature(feat_), fixes (fix_), documentation (doc_)

### Implementation with CircleCI

#### First connection

CircleCI is an CICD platform which has a free proposal; 
To be able to use CircleCI we need : 
* Create an account

  ![circleci-create-user.png](circleci-create-user.png)

* set up your code

  ![img.png](img.png)

* Create settings

There are tree possibilities to links your project with your future CI:

![circleci-create-settings.png](circleci-create-settings.png)



#### Creation of job

CircleCI defines "jobs" which are executables tasks; each job can  be divided in steps
In early version of our CI we want to:
* build the jar file
* run the unit tests
* run the integration tests
* run the system testThe s

### Implementation with GitHub Action

#### Terminology

Workflow: In the official documentation a workflow is defined as: "A workflow is a configurable automated process that will execute one or more jobs.
It is set up via a yaml file
https://docs.github.com/fr/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows

action: "Actions are individual tasks that you can combine to create jobs and customize your workflow."
https://docs.github.com/fr/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions

####  first connection

GitHub Action is the integrated continuous integration tool of GitHUb.
It is accessible from the Action button in a toolbar
![github_action_menu.png](github_action_menu.png)

At first access, GithUb Action displays a workflow proposal according to your project.
In our case we have selected the java with gradle workflow.

![github_action_gradle.png](github_action_gradle.png)

Once selected our workflow, we are redirected on the editor proposing us a default file.
It is possible to modify it and save it on a specific branch; In order to easily test the CICD without having to push on develop, it is possible to
define the name of the working branch dna sla part push.

### Creation of jobs



````yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - develop
    - ci_* 
````


To implement the 3 steps, defined above, we need to create the jobs:

* assemble: to compile the code and cr√©er le jar.
* spotless: to check the format of new code.
* unit-tests: to execute the unit tests.
* integration-tests: to execute the integration tests.
* system-tests: to execute the system tests.

the code below show an exemple to create a job


````yml
jobs:
  assemble:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: gradle
    - run: ./gradlew assemble --no-daemon

````


In the above code :

* we create the assemble job which is based on ubuntu-latest
* we use two actions to check the code and configure Java
* we run the gradle assemble job




## Summary
The first objective of this article was to test 3 cicd engines (GitLab, CircleCi and GitHub Action), implementing the same CI.
While trying to implement the cicd on these engines, I quickly encountered some limitations for the first two:

* on GitLab you can't push the result of the cicd to GitHub
* on CircleCi the total size limit of the artefacts and their retention time were not compatible with our objectives.
  https://app.circleci.com/settings/plan/github/talk-to-the-duck/overview?return-to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.circleci.com%2Fprojects%2Fproject-dashboard%2Fgithub%2Ftalk-to-the-duck%2F
In this case, only the GitHub action is completely useful.


As a conclusion I think that to set up a free CICD, it is preferable to use a CI integrated with its version manager such as GItHub Action for GitHub or GitLab CICD for GitLab.
